## About Me
I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Vermont, advised by [Prof. Safwan W. Shah](https://www.wshahaigroup.com/). My research centers on Geospatial AI, Remote Sensing, and Time-Series Forecasting for environmental monitoring, with a particular focus on water quality assessment.

Currently, I am developing a pixel-level forecasting system for Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms in Lake Champlain. This work aims to develop a remote-sensing-only framework that is scalable for lakes worldwide, leveraging publicly available satellite data.

I am always eager to explore new opportunities for collaboration. If my research aligns with your interests or if you would like to discuss potential partnerships, please feel free to reach out.
